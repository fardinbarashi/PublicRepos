# Microsoft 365 Endpoints


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The Office 365 IP Address and URL web service assists users in better identifying and distinguishing Office 365 network traffic, making it easier to assess, configure, and stay updated on changes. This REST-based web service replaces the previously downloadable XML files, which were phased out on October 2, 2018. This script checks for the required IP addresses for M365 Endpoints.
